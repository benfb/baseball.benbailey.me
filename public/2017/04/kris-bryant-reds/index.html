			 	<h1>Kris Bryant Loves the Reds</h1>
			  <span class="post-date">Tue, Apr 4, 2017</span>
			      <p>Kris Bryant was very good last year. The Reds were&hellip;not great last year. In fact, the Reds&rsquo; bullpen was historically bad. Early in the season they <a href="http://m.mlb.com/news/article/176059016/reds-bullpen-has-record-streak-allowing-runs/">set a record for consecutive games allowing at least one run</a>, and later in the season they <a href="http://m.reds.mlb.com/news/article/201830542/reds-bullpens-sets-record-for-homers-allowed/">set a record for home runs allowed</a>.</p>

<p>Kris Bryant, of course, was the National League MVP.</p>

<p>This is what Kris Bryant did to normal pitching in 699 plate appearances:</p>

<tbody>

<p>This is what Kris Bryant did to Reds pitching in 88 plate appearances:</p>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>.364</td>
<td>10</td>
<td>.443</td>
<td>.831</td>
<td>165</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>More than 25% of his home runs were against the Reds. A more modest 20.7% of his extra-base hits were against the Reds.</p>

<p>This was Reds pitching against everyone:</p>

<table>

<tr>
<th>ERA</th>

<th>HR</th>
<th>K/BB</th>
<th>OPS+</th>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>4.91</td>

<p>This was Reds Pitching against the Cubs:</p>

<td>125</td>

</tbody>

<p>tOPS+ is a measure of how well a player performed in this split as opposed to their average. Against-Reds Kris Bryant is to normal Kris Bryant as normal Kris Bryant is to a league-average hitter.</p>

<p>sOPS+ shows how well a player performed in a split compared to the league average in that split. Bryant&rsquo;s sOPS+ against the Reds was 211. That speaks for itself.</p>

<p>The advanced batted ball data backs up Bryant&rsquo;s Reds dominance:</p>

<tr>
<th>Reds?</th>
<th>Angle</th>
<th>Velocity</th>
<th>Distance</th>
<th>Barrel %</th>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>No</td>
<td>19.5</td>
