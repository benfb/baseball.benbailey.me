			 	<h1>What Happens After a Home Run?</h1>
			  <span class="post-date">Sat, Sep 29, 2018</span>
			      <p>We all know what a home run looks like. It&rsquo;s one of baseball&rsquo;s most common, though perhaps not best, types of highlights.</p>
<p>It has always seemed to me that batters are more likely to swing at the first pitch after a home run.</p>
<p>This plot shows the likelihood of the first pitch after a home run being a called strike plotted against the likelihood that the first pitch of any plate appearance is a called strike.</p>
<p><img src="/images/after_hr/called.png" alt=""></p>
<p>This is the same plot for pitches put in play:</p>
<p><img src="/images/after_hr/in_play.png" alt=""></p>
<p>And for whiffs (swings and misses):</p>
<p><img src="/images/after_hr/whiffs.png" alt=""></p>
<p>And for whiffs + in play (all swinging strikes):</p>
<p><img src="/images/after_hr/whiffs_and_in_play.png" alt=""></p>
<p>As a rule, called strikes on the first pitch of a plate appearance go down after a home run, whereas whiffs and balls put in play go up.</p>
<p><img src="/images/after_hr/all_strikes.png" alt=""></p>
<p>What can we conclude from this?</p>
<p>Generally batters are more agressive on the first pitch after a home run, while pitchers are more cautious. This is fairly intuitive. Somewhere in the back of the batter&rsquo;s mind is the fact that his teammate was able to hit a home run. And, in the pitcher&rsquo;s mind, the same thing.</p>
<p>Of course, this could partially be explained by logic. In some situations, if a pitcher just gave up a home run, perhaps his stuff or his control are waning. Either factor could lead a pitcher to miss outside the zone. Perhaps the location of the home run pitch itself missed its location inside the zone; a hanging slider or floating changeup.</p>
<p>Fun note: Teoscar Hernandez led all of baseball in swings and misses after home runs in 2018 with 7. The Yankees, perhaps unsurprisingly, led as a team with 21.</p>
