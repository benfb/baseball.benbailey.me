Kris Bryant was very good last year. The Reds were...not great last year. In fact, the Reds' bullpen was historically bad. Early in the season they [set a record for consecutive games allowing at least one run][runsal], and later in the season they [set a record for home runs allowed][hrsal].

Kris Bryant, of course, was the National League MVP.

This is what Kris Bryant did to normal pitching in 699 plate appearances:

| BA | HR | OBP | SLG | OPS+ |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| .292 | 29 | .385 | .554 | 149 |

This is what Kris Bryant did to Reds pitching in 88 plate appearances:

| BA | HR | OBP | SLG | tOPS+ |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| .364 | 10 | .443 | .831 | 165 |

More than 25% of his home runs were against the Reds. A more modest 20.7% of his extra-base hits were against the Reds.

This was Reds pitching against everyone:

| ERA | BA | HR | K/BB | OPS+ |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 4.91 | .263 | 258 | 1.95 | 116 |

This was Reds Pitching against the Cubs:

| ERA | BA | HR | K/BB | tOPS+ |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 6.99 | .285 | 42 | 1.39 | 125 |

tOPS+ is a measure of how well a player performed in this split as opposed to their average. Against-Reds Kris Bryant is to normal Kris Bryant as normal Kris Bryant is to a league-average hitter.

sOPS+ shows how well a player performed in a split compared to the league average in that split. Bryant's sOPS+ against the Reds was 211. That speaks for itself.

The advanced batted ball data backs up Bryant's Reds dominance:

| Reds? | Angle | Velocity | Distance | Barrel % |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| No | 19.5 | 89.6 | 235.1 | 16.4% |
| Yes | 21.9 | 91.3 | 250.1 | 22.9% |
