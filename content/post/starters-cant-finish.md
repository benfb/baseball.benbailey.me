Some starters can't finish innings. More specifically, some starters are pretty good at getting two outs, but much worse at getting the third. In looking at potential ways to identify starters who may work better as relievers, I came across Baseball Reference's number of outs splits. To find good candidates for this analysis, I looked at [Fangraphs' splits leaderboard for worst ERA with two outs][leaderboard]. I took the top (or bottom) three pitchers with more than 30 IP: Tyler Duffey, Anibal Sanchez, and Michael Pineda.

As a side note, both Jordan Zimmerman and Mike Pelfrey are in the top 20 ERA wise as well, so something weird is going on in Detroit with two outs.

Here's the essential tables:

**Tyler Duffey**

| Outs | ERA | tOPS+ | sOPS+ |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 4.74 | 100 | 128 |
| 1 | 5.15 | 66 | 94 |
| 2 | 9.90 | 132 | 184 |

**Anibal Sanchez**

| Outs | ERA | tOPS+ | sOPS+ |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 4.22 | 114 | 132 |
| 1 | 3.96 | 55 | 72 |
| 2 | 9.82 | 125 | 160 |

**Michael Pineda**

| Outs | ERA | tOPS+ | sOPS+ |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 2.47 | 75 | 80 |
| 1 | 3.53 | 71 | 80 |
| 2 | 8.84 | 148 | 172 |

All three of these pitchers allowed a better than league average OPS with one out. Michael Pineda was better than league average with both zero and one out(s). However, he's worse than Anibal Sanchez at his worst with two outs!
